## Angular Trainee Program - week 4

This **angular project** translates the static design of the image above ('Model' part) into components ('App' part), so the image compares both parts<br/>

### Issues to consider:<br/>

◽ Split the design into multiple components, at least 6 components<br/>
◽ Cannot use CSS framework like bootstrap<br/>
◽ Use flexbox or CSS grid<br/>
◽ Use any image files for the design<br/>
◽ Avoid using global CSS <br/>
◽ Use images for the graphics<br/>
◽ Use string interpolation and property binding when I consider it appropriate, using each at least one time<br/>
◽ The page has to be responsive<br/>
◽ Configure Prettier and ESLint<br/>

### Extra Credits

How to get extra points?<br/>
◽ Using SASS<br/>
◽ Uploading the code on any free hosting and provide the URL<br/>
◽ Using event binding or two-way binding to add some kind of functionality to the page<br/>

I hope you like it!
